Getting hpaste installed and running:

1) Install the python library pygments
2) Create a new sqlite3 database using the initialize.sql file
   This file must exist in a directory that the cgi application will
   have write priviledges to as sqlite3 creates temp files!
3) Create an hpaste.conf file with can be "read" as a Config object
4) Add hpaste.fcgi to your cgi-bin and enable fastcgi support in your httpd.
5) Add highlighter.py to your cgi-bin.

The bot will expect to be able to be able to read a Config object as well
as the fastcgi application. It will create a socket that will likely have
the wrong permissions if the httpd and bot run as different users. The httpd
needs +w permissions on the socket.
